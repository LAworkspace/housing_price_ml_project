# housing_price_ml_project
Predicting property Sale Prices in a city.
Overview

In this challenging project with R, you&#39;ll analyze New York City condominium sales data to
predict prices based on property size. Using R and linear regression modeling techniques, you&#39;ll
clean and explore the dataset, visualize relationships between variables, and build predictive
models. You&#39;ll compare model performance across NYC&#39;s five boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn,
Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island), gaining valuable experience in real estate data analysis
and statistical modeling. This project will strengthen your skills in data cleaning, exploratory
analysis, and interpreting regression results in a practical business context.

Tools and Technologies

● R
● tidyverse
● Linear regression
● ggplot2

Prerequisites

To successfully complete this project, you should be familiar with linear regression modeling in
R and have experience with:
● Data manipulation and cleaning using tidyverse functions
● Creating scatterplots and other visualizations with ggplot2
● Fitting and interpreting linear regression models in R
● Evaluating model performance using metrics like R-squared and RMSE
● Basic understanding of real estate market dynamics

Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Load and clean the NYC condominium sales dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis, visualizing relationships between
property size and sale price
3. Identify and handle outliers that may impact model performance
4. Build a linear regression model for all NYC boroughs combined
5. Create separate models for each borough and compare their
performance
6. Interpret results and draw conclusions about price prediction across
different areas of NYC

Expected Outcomes

Upon completing this project, you&#39;ll have gained valuable skills and experience, including:
● Cleaning and preparing real estate data for analysis in R
● Visualizing and interpreting relationships between property features and
prices
● Building and comparing linear regression models across different
market segments
● Evaluating model performance and understanding limitations in real
estate price prediction
● Translating statistical results into actionable insights for real estate
analysis
